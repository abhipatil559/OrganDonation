    <b style="background-color: aliceblue;"> “Be a hero, be an organ donor. Life is a gift. Pass it on.”
      “Donate life! The gift of organ donation is the greatest gift of all.”
      you can save or improve as many as 75 lives.
      It is a procedure in which a health organ (donor) is taken from an individual who is either living or deceased and
      is transplanted into a person whose respective orphan (recipient) is malfunctioning.
      Donated organs give the recipient the opportunity of a longer and better quality of life.
      Quality of life: Transplants can greatly improve a recipient's health and quality of life, allowing them to return
      to normal activities.
      Increased life span: A kidney transplant dramatically increases the life span of a patient by about 10 years and
      improves their quality of life.
