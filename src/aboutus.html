We are committed to spreading awareness for the importance of cadaver organ donation. We were established for two purposes: <br> <br>

 To spread awareness and make cadaver donation possible, by increasing the number of cadaver organ donations in India and facilitating the entire process.
 To prevent the alarming number of kidney and liver failure cases that happen in India and also provide them with a new lease of life.</p>
